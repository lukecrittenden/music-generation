## Examples of Approaches to Computer-Based Music Generation

### Simple rule-based system
This example showcases an algorithmic rule-based system for generating piano melodies with harmonisation in 4/4 time, where the output can be in any major or minor key. This is a very simple, straightforward approach to rule-based music generation.

### Graph-traversal-based system
This example makes use of the graph traversal method for generating chord progressions.
